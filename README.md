<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> Our program is a lyrics library where you can search up a song by its name and artist or just search through an artist's albums to find a song. Once a song is selected, it brings you to a page displaying its lyrics and an audio file can be played through the page that reads you the lyrics. You may also have an account if you want to save your favorite songs somewhere. </p>
